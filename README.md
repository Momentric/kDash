# kDash
A dashboard for your tablet, TV or web browser which allows you to view your Kiezelpay sales data via your API key. It's a heavily modified version of the [K·pay merchant API module](https://github.com/KiezelPay/fitbit_kpay_merchant_api).

## How does it work?

👉 Add your kPay API key by pasting it in the lower right corner of the page. Find your API key here: https://kiezelpay.com/account/api

👉 If it doesn't update after adding the API key, you may need to refresh the page.

ℹ️ kDash will refresh every 5 minutes.

## Demo

You can try it out here: https://john-reno.github.io/kDash/index.html

## Usage

Open the HTML file locally, or upload it somewhere to use. The documentation for the Kiezelpay API can be found here: https://kiezelpay.com/api/merchant/documentation

## Note

Please ensure you take adequate care with your API key. Do not enter your API into anything you do not trust, as your sales data may be viewed by others. kDash will not expose your API key, however please take precaution with any other apps or clock faces that ask for your Kiezelpay API key, and ensure you are able to see that your API is not being exposed. Your API key is stored in the localstorage of your browser, and you can clear it if needed via your browser's devtools.
